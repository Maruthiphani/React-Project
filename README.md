# Item Management System - React UI with ASP.NET Core Web API

Welcome to the Item Management System repository! This project provides users with a powerful and user-friendly interface to manipulate data related to items. The system is built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies, offering a seamless experience for both administrators and end-users.

## Technologies and Features

- **React UI**: The frontend of this application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. The use of props, hooks, and arrow functions within the React components ensures a responsive and dynamic user experience.

- **Bootstrap Styling**: The UI is enhanced with Bootstrap, a CSS framework that aids in creating clean and visually appealing designs. This results in a consistent and modern look for the entire application.

- **ASP.NET Core Web API Middleware**: Serving as the backend middleware, the ASP.NET Core Web API handles various API requests from the frontend. This middleware ensures secure data communication between the React UI and the database.

- **SQL Database**: The project's data is stored in an SQL database, allowing for efficient and structured data management. To optimize performance, the use of stored procedures (procs) is employed, enhancing the speed of data retrieval and manipulation.

- **Dapper ORM**: For database interactions, Dapper, a micro ORM, is utilized. Dapper's lightweight nature and efficient query execution provide a performance boost, making it an ideal choice for real-time applications.

-**SQL**: Created tables and stored procs that helps the user to manupulate the data and make performance faster.
